Description: A tidy framework for automatic knowledge classification and visualization. Currently, the core functionality of the framework is mainly supported by modularity-based clustering (community detection) in keyword co-occurrence network, and focuses on co-word analysis of bibliometric research. However, the designed functions in 'akc' are general, and could be extended to solve other tasks in text mining as well.
